	<!-- Maintenance -->

    <BF_MaintenanceDesc>Maintenance is a measure of a pawn's core memory and system health - it is only tangentially related to physical part health and is primarily meditative. Maintenance degrades over time, and must be built by androids having sufficient free time to tend to their internal health. Poor maintenance degrades efficiency, and may lead to physical part failures due to critical repair errors if allowed to persist for too long.\n\nA high level of maintenance provides small benefits, but also greatly increases maintenance loss - leading most androids to pursue a middle of the road approach.\n\nNote: provided values are baseline rates, actual fall rate depends on the pawn's maintenance efficiency (in info tab)</BF_MaintenanceDesc>

    <BF_MaintenanceEffectDesc>Average maintenance is a measure of how well maintained this unit's core memory and internal systems have been over time, and changes based on the maintenance level of the pawn. High levels will improve mood, while low levels will degrade both mood and health. It rises if maintenance is above 70% and falls if below 30%, and otherwise slowly returns to a baseline.\n\nNote: maintenance is a personal, deeply introspective activity, and therefore can largely not be done by others for a pawn except in emergency situations with a part pack.</BF_MaintenanceEffectDesc>
